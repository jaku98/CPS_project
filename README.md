Description:

The aim of the project is to carry out an analog sound intensity measurement using a condenser microphone and the Raspberry Pi 4 platform. The signal was processed using the "Python" programming language.
The project involves the use of an inexpensive microphone that will enable the recording of the soundtrack. The Raspberry Pi will allow you to save and acquire the signal spectrum. The recorded sound can be played back. The program provides the display of the signal in the frequency (FFT) and time domain.
The project presents the wide possibilities of the Raspberry Pi and simple solutions that can be used in the process of digital signal processing. The VS Code editor with the installed Python package and the required libraries was used to write the program.
